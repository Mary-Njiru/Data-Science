# Data-Science
This project contains stacks and tuples and shows how to access elements, add and remove from both tuples and stacks
## Tuples
A tuple is an ordered set of values that stores multiple data types. They are immutable and separated by a comma, inside the parenthesis. To change a change, you must first convert it into a list and then add or remove elements and change it back to a tuple, since tuples are immutable.
## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. It follows the LIFO method of Last In, First Out, where you have to follow an order of adding and removing elements in a stack.

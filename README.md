# Data-Science
This project contains stacks and tuples and shows how to access elements, add and remove from both tuples and stacks
## Tuples
A tuple is an ordered set of values that stores multiple data types. They are immutable and separated by a comma, inside the parenthesis. To change a change, you must first convert it into a list and then add or remove elements and change it back to a tuple, since tuples are immutable.
A tuple is a data structure that is an ordered set of values that stores multiple values.
A tuple can hold data of many data kinds such as strings and integers.

## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. It follows the LIFO method of Last In, First Out, where you have to follow an order of adding and removing elements in a stack.
Insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.
